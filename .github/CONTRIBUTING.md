## Github

### Commits

### Pull Requests

When initially opening a pull request, please open it in **draft** mode, and do not mark it for review. Please fill out the template with as much detail as you can.

Once you are done implementing the feature, make sure that your code follows the style guides laid out in the README, and all status checks are passing. Then, mark the pull request as ready for review.

Start pull request titles with emojis! Here's a list of some that you can use, or you can choose a random one:

- :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
- :book: `:book:` when writing docs
- :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
- :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
- :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
- :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
- :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings
